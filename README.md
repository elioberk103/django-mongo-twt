Django-Mongo-Twt on OpenShift Express
=====================================

This is a simple twitter clone along the lines of 
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-twt-mongo-demo

The aim is to use MongoDB with Mongoengine, a convenient wrapper library over 
PyMongo that emulates most of the common Django functionality, including auth.
The result is a familiar API for database access so that the switch to NoSQL
MongoDB can be relatively painless for Django users.

Please drop me a line if you find any bugs/glitches.
